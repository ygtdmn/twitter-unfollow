# twitter-unfollow
GPT-4 generated web app to unfollow people that don't follow you back. Also, you can add them to a list.

# Prompts
I used these prompts to create this script:
- Create a node.js script to unfollow people that don't follow me back. Use Twitter API and create a webp interface.
- Now add a feature to add people to a predefined list.
- Add pagination

Also, it gave me wrong code sometimes and I responded with error messages. I wanted some CSS changes too and that's it.

# Usage
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Clone the repo and open the terminal in the repo's folder
3. Use `npm install`
4. Edit app.js to fill it with your Twitter API tokens and list id
5. Use `node app` to run the script
6. Visit https://localhost:3000 to use the app
